Serialization:
“The process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file is called Serialization”
            In Connect Em, we used Serialization to store huge information of user in one file that can easily accessible. Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed.

Deserialization:
            The reverse process of Serialization is called 
“Deserialization”


Friendship Graph:
            In Connect Em we used a friendship graph in this way that, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then there is an edge between them. In the backend of the graph we are using Adjacent List.
